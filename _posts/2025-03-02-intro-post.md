So... Uhhh *nervously taps mic* I hope this thing is working.

Anyway, I decided to finally come back to working on this site and expanding on what Jekyll is actually capable of doing. In other words, I started a blog.

Not really sure what I'm uploading here, or even who would actually see all this stuff. Hopefully it gets picked up by a search engine perhaps,  idk honestly. Perhaps I'll post some things here frequently, perhaps I might not, but I might as well make use of it.
